# Medicine Reminder using Arduino
Sometimes patients forget to take the medicine at the required time of medicines. And sometimes patient also forgets which medicine He/She have
to take at required time. And it is difficult for Doctor/Compounder to monitor patients around the clock. To avoid this problem, we have made 
this medicine reminder system for patients using Arduino.

Programming & Components :
1. Wire.h:  for I2C interfacing

2. RTClib.h: for RTC interfaicng

3. LiquidCrystal: for 16X2 LCD interfacing

4. EEPROM.h: for access the internal Arduinoâ€™s EEPROM for saving the alarm time.
